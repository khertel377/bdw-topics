					<p>This article did a nice job of reviewing some of the basics of HTML and how document outlines had worked in previous versions, specifically how it relied entirely on implicit sections, or using the headings h1-h6 to organize the outline's structure.  It made clear that even now, in HTML5, only two things in mark-up will affect the outline: heading content (implicit sectioning using h1-h6) and sectioning content (explicit sectioning using section, article, aside, and nav), providing examples of how these two types of sectioning can and cannot work together.  It then went on to discuss some common mistakes and pitfalls (untitled sections, untitled documents, how to use sectioning roots, hgroups, etc) that come about using explicit sectioning and how to avoid/fix these issues.  It got a little technical or hard to follow at points, but I found it was helpful to copy/paste the examples given on the page into the HTML5 Outliner from class to really begin to grasp the concepts it was addressing.</p>

					<p>After getting a solid foundational understanding of the HTML5 document outline in the preceding article, this article provided a solid review and helped fill in some cracks as far as why we should even care about this new functionality of the sectioning elements in HTML5.  The outline, the article reminds the reader, is the structure of the HTML document, mapping out the different sections to be used for the table of contents, in assistive technology (screen-readers), and search engines.  It then goes into the specifics of the sectioning elements, hgroups, and sectioning roots.  Since I covered those above, I won't repeat myself here, but hearing the same information in a new way and with fresh examples definitely helped reinforce the concepts.  Finally, and I really appreciated this section, it covered "Outlines in the Real World," and revealed that there is little support for the new outlining algorithms.  Search engines still treat them much the same as before, and screen readers may not interpret the sectioning structure correctly, so it makes sense to still try to logically nest your heading levels until there is greater adoption.  Plus, once there is more support for the outlining algorithms, it will be a good habit to have already formed and adopted.</p>
